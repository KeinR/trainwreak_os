- Paging
- user mode
- elf file parser
- filesystem driver
    - Unix file system? Minix? Ext2 seems like a good choice...
- Audio driver
- Pixel buffer mode
- Map interrupts to syscalls
- standard library (with syscalls using interrupts)
- malloc function
- Scheduler (aka multitasking)
- Use stb_image for image decompression (re-map malloc, realloc, etc.), stb_vorbis...
    - Or use own custom...
- Get the actual VESA framebuffer location by looping through the modes
- Add a git for my config files (this is getting dumb)
